Hash Table as a Set: 

//create a hash table class
//create a constructor that instantiates a set when it is called by the new keyword, give it a specific size
//create a method called add that will take an input, hash that function, and add that input to the hash table in the specific index
//create a method called contains that will check if an input is in the hash table and return a boolean
//create a hash function algorithm that will turn a value into a string and then to a character array, then reduce that array into a number value using modulo

Hash Table as an Associative Array (with linked lists to prevent clustering)

//create a class for node and linked list to instatiate and use its methods in a hash table
    //create a class Node 
        //that has a constructor with a data and a next 

    //create a linked list that has 4 methods: finding a node, finding a key, updating a node
        
        //create a constructor that will instatiate the head at null, length at 0
        
        //create a method that adds a node to the linked list
            //this method should instantiate a new node with a key and a value
            //it should identify the next node from the new node as this.head
            //it should make the new node the new this.head
       
        //create a method that finds the node (its key) in the linked list
            //check if the head is the key, if it is return that key
            //iterate through the list until you find the key by reassigning the head to next
            //return this.head

        //create a method that updates the node (its key and value) in the LL
            //find the node using its key (or in our case, call the findNode method with the key)
            //assign that to a variable node
            //assign the value to that node object

        //create a method that finds the key
            //find the node using its key in the LL
            //assign that variable to a the keyFound
            //return the value if it exists otherwise return null

Hash Table as an Object:

//create a hash table class
//create a constructor that instantiates a set when it is called by the new keyword, give it a specific size
//create a method called add that will take an input, hash that function, and add that input to the hash table in the specific index
//create a method called contains that will check if an input is in the hash table and return a boolean
//create a hash function algorithm that will turn a value into a string and then to a character array, then reduce that array into a number value using modulo
